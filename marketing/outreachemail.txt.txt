Hello,my name is Leonardo and I am a young developer / entrepreneur, I am currently conducting market research for an upcoming service that would allow streamers such as yourself to play copyrighted content over their streams, such as music, videos (YouTube or otherwise), etc. without infringing on the owner's copyright. 
Would you be interested in such a service?
If yes, please reply to this email,Sincerely,Leonardo Puzzuoli
